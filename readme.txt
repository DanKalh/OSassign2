Process file weren't touched this time. I added descriptive comments like last time as well as created extra resource names, again like last time. The program simulates process scheduling using Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Least Laxity First (LLF) scheduling algorithms, along with Banker's (for deadlock) for resource allocation. I had issues with the master string print being inconsistent, but I can't lose more points for lateness.
